# Sai Siri Tammineni — Portfolio

## Overview
I am a software engineer focused on full-stack development, AI systems, and Python automation. This repository curates selected projects and work samples that reflect how I build reliable software, ship practical AI features, and automate workflows end to end.

## Focus Areas
- Full-stack applications with clean APIs and maintainable front-end architecture
- AI systems that combine model reasoning with production-ready workflows
- Python automation for data pipelines, developer tooling, and operational efficiency

## Flagship Projects
- DataPulse AI: Python automation + AI for log analysis and incident summarization
- Crypto Stream: full-stack real-time cryptocurrency tracking application
- Emotive Chat: emotion-aware AI chatbot using sentiment and context analysis

## Technical Skills
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL
- Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express

- Data & Infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, REST APIs
- Automation: scripting, task orchestration, system integrations

## Learning Philosophy
I focus on fundamentals first, then apply them through small, testable experiments. I document decisions, measure outcomes, and refine based on feedback. This keeps my work grounded in evidence and makes it easier to maintain and extend.
