## Overview
I am a software engineer focused on full-stack development, AI systems, and Python automation. This repository showcases selected projects that reflect how I design reliable software, integrate practical AI features, and automate workflows end to end.

## Focus Areas
- Full-stack applications with clean APIs and maintainable front-end architecture
- AI systems that combine model reasoning with production-ready workflows
- Python automation for data pipelines, developer tooling, and operational efficiency

## Flagship Projects
- DataPulse AI: - DataPulse AI: Python automation and AI-driven log analysis for incident summarization  
  → Technical deep dive: [projects/datapulse-ai.md](projects/datapulse-ai.md)
- CryptoStream: real-time cryptocurrency price streaming platform  
  → Technical deep dive: [projects/crypto-stream.md](projects/crypto-stream.md)
- EmotiveChat: BERT-based emotion classification for sentiment-aware conversations  
  → Technical deep dive: [projects/emotive-chat.md](projects/emotive-chat.md)

## Learning Log
This section captures cross-project engineering learnings and design
patterns discovered while building real-world AI and real-time systems.
