# Experience


## Software Development & Digital Systems Research Assistant
**Texas A&M University�Corpus Christi � International Student Programs & Services (ISPS)**
This role centered on internal systems that had to be correct, traceable, and resilient under policy and compliance constraints. The work shaped how I think about data lifecycles, auditability, and designing automation that people can trust.
- Built and maintained internal web tools that handled sensitive records with clear validation paths.
- Automated steps in compliance-oriented workflows to reduce manual handling and error risk.
- Implemented backend logic and data checks to keep records consistent over time.
- Improved reliability by making failure states visible and recoverable.
- The focus on traceability influenced how I design AI-assisted workflows later.

## Photography & Web Content Developer
**Texas A&M University�Corpus Christi � Marketing & Communications**
This role was about keeping digital content systems stable and usable while supporting time-sensitive updates. The constraints were practical: reliable publishing, accessible pages, and predictable performance under real traffic.
- Shipped frontend changes that prioritized clarity, accessibility, and consistent layout behavior.
- Built repeatable content pipelines that reduced manual edits and publishing errors.
- Kept workflows predictable so updates could move quickly without breaking pages.
- The experience reinforced a discipline of clean UI boundaries and minimal complexity.

## Software Engineer Intern
**Wipro Technologies**
This role exposed me to production-oriented systems where stability and observability matter as much as new features. It reinforced the value of clean interfaces, defensive data handling, and release hygiene.
- Worked on backend services and APIs that integrated with existing enterprise systems.
- Touched databases and deployment workflows where rollback and monitoring were critical.
- Gained exposure to CI/CD practices and operational readiness checks.
- The production focus shaped my approach to performance and failure isolation.

## How These Experiences Shaped My Engineering Approach
- Automation has to be auditable or it does not scale.
- Reliability is designed up front, not bolted on after failures.
- Systems should make failure modes observable and recovery straightforward.
- Ownership includes lifecycle decisions, not just feature delivery.
- Practical constraints improve architecture more than abstract ideals.
